# MyHealthJournal

MyHealthJournal is a simple React project I built to manually track my health habits. It helps me stay aware of what I eat, how many steps I take, and other daily health-related activities like avoiding sugar.

I created this project primarily to practice coding and build something useful for myself. While there are many health trackers out there, I wanted to create my own.

I might scale this project in the future â€” or I might not :))
